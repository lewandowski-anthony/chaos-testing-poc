## ðŸ“¸ Before starting

Chaos Engineering is an emerging discipline aiming to improve system resilience by intentionally injecting faults and failures into production or staging environments. This POC explores two popular open-source Kubernetes-native chaos engineering toolsâ€”Chaos Mesh and LitmusChaosâ€”deployed on a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, K3s.

To better understand the ecosystem and available options, here is a detailed overview of various tools currently available for chaos testing, their licensing, pricing, and core strengths.

### Available Tools

| Tool Name                     | Open Source | Pricing Model               | Key Features                                                                 | Notes                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Chaos Mesh**                | Yes         | Free (Open Source)          | Designed natively for Kubernetes, offers a rich set of fault injections (network, pod, time, IO, etc.), integrates tightly with container runtimes such as containerd. Easy to install and use, with an active community backing it. | Ideal for cloud-native environments, lightweight, and supports granular chaos experiments. |
| **LitmusChaos**               | Yes         | Free (Open Source)          | Kubernetes-native chaos engineering framework with seamless integration in CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, and multi-cloud support. Rich dashboard and experiment repository. | Focus on automation and developer-friendly workflows, good for GitOps-driven chaos. |
| **Gremlin**                   | No          | Starts at ~$99/month        | Commercial SaaS product offering enterprise-grade chaos testing across multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Provides a polished UI, detailed reporting, and comprehensive support options. | Best suited for enterprises needing support and multi-environment testing but at a cost. |
| **Chaos Monkey**              | Yes         | Free (Open Source)          | Originally developed by Netflix, simulates random instance and VM failures, mainly focused on AWS environments. | Simple tool but limited to specific cloud providers and types of failures. |
| **PowerfulSeal**              | Yes         | Free (Open Source)          | Kubernetes-focused chaos testing with policy-driven controls and scheduling. It allows dynamic discovery of pods and nodes to target chaos. | Great for Kubernetes but less user-friendly compared to Chaos Mesh or LitmusChaos. |
| **AWS Fault Injection Simulator** | No    | Pay-as-you-go (AWS pricing) | Fully managed fault injection service integrated into AWS ecosystem, enabling safe and controlled experiments for AWS services. | Highly scalable and managed but potentially expensive and AWS-specific. |

## Why did we test only Chaos Mesh and Litmus?

When embarking on this POC, we carefully considered a range of chaos engineering tools based on several key factors:

- **Open Source & Kubernetes Native:** Both Chaos Mesh and LitmusChaos are open source projects explicitly designed for Kubernetes. This is essential as our environment is based on **K3s**, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, ensuring seamless integration and minimal overhead.

- **Strong Community & Continuous Development:** Both projects boast active communities and frequent releases. This translates into timely bug fixes, feature enhancements, and a wealth of community-driven documentation and support. This aspect is critical during POC stages to reduce troubleshooting times.

- **Rich Feature Sets with Simplicity:** They offer comprehensive chaos experiments â€” including network delays, pod failures, resource hogs, time skew, and more â€” but remain straightforward to install and operate, especially important in a proof-of-concept phase where setup complexity should be minimized.

- **Cost Effectiveness:** As open-source tools, they impose no licensing costs. This is ideal for experimental and educational projects where budget constraints are typical.

- **Strong Integration Capabilities:** LitmusChaos excels in automation-friendly workflows, fitting naturally into CI/CD pipelines and GitOps methodologies, while Chaos Mesh is well-optimized for containerd runtimes used by K3s, offering low-level chaos injection support.

While other tools such as Gremlin or AWS Fault Injection Simulator offer robust enterprise-grade features and managed services, they are either costly or cloud-provider-specific, making them less suitable for lightweight, self-hosted POCs or experimental setups.
