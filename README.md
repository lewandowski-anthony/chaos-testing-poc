# Chaos Engineering POC Repository

Welcome to this Proof of Concept (POC) repository dedicated to **Chaos Engineering** in Kubernetes environments.  
This repo aims to provide a practical, hands-on setup using lightweight Kubernetes (k3s), along with two popular open-source chaos engineering tools: **Chaos Mesh** and **Litmus**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of this Repository

Chaos Engineering is a discipline focused on improving system resilience by intentionally injecting faults and failures.  
The goal here is to demonstrate how to deploy, configure, and run chaos experiments in a lightweight Kubernetes cluster, enabling developers and operators to better understand failure modes and improve system robustness.

This POC covers:

- Installing a Kubernetes cluster using **k3s** (a lightweight Kubernetes distribution ideal for local and edge environments)  
- Deploying **Chaos Mesh** and **Litmus** chaos engineering platforms, each with complementary strengths  
- Creating example test applications (like NGINX) to run chaos experiments against  
- Providing scripts and documentation for easy setup, testing, and teardown

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started quickly, run the provided installation script which will:

- Set up k3s Kubernetes cluster with containerd runtime  
- Install Helm package manager  
- Create necessary Kubernetes namespaces  
- Deploy Chaos Mesh and Litmus for chaos experiments  
- Deploy example applications for testing  

Run this command with root privileges (e.g. using `sudo`):

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
